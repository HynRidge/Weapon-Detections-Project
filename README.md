# Weapon Detections

## Project Description
The project is about how we can use images to detect weapons do a data classification into 3 categories, which includes normal, threat, or carrying weapon,.

<b>Normal</b> means that no weapons are detected in the image. <b>Threat</b> means that weapons are detected in the image but the holder / actor is not in any threatening stance. For example, a police keeping a gun in the holster. <b>Carrying</b> means that a weapon is detected in the images and the actor / holder is in threatening stance. For example, a robber holding a gain aiming at a hostages.

The project consists of the preprocessing steps done to the training images as well as the LeNet-5 model used to classify the images. In addition to that, there is also a grad-cam steps to analyze the results of the model further.
